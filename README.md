# After Midnight (Node)

A terminal based version of the classic dice game

## THE RULES

---------

After Midnight (or 1-4-24) is a dice game played with 6 dice.
One player rolls at a time. 
He rolls 6 dice, and keeps at least one. 
Any that the player doesn't keep are rerolled. 
This procedure is then repeated 
until there are no more dice to roll. 
Once kept, dice cannot be rerolled. 
Players must have kept a 1 and a 4, or they are disqualified. 
If they have a 1 and 4, the other dice are totaled to give the player's score. 
The maximum score is therefore 24. 
The procedure is repeated for the remaining players. 
The player with the highest 4 dice total wins.
